### Week 10 &mdash; Continue Schr&ouml;dinger Equation Examples &mdash; Exam 3

* Tuesday, Mar. 26 &mdash; No new reading or problem set &mdash; In-class, we will analyze the [particle in a finitely-deep potential well](./resources/ParticleInAPotentialWell.nb.pdf), and [the raising and lowering operators for the harmonic oscillator](./resources/HarmonicOscillatorRaisingAndLowering.nb.pdf) (my writeup is a small taste of [operator methods](./HarmonicOscillatorSolutionUsingOperators.pdf) that are used a lot in quantum field theory because free field theories, including quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the absence of any charges, can be analyzed using the same raising and lowering operator methods as are used for the harmonic oscillator)
* Friday, Mar. 29 &mdash; [Exam 3](./exams/Exam3.nb.pdf) covering Problem Sets 10-13 and Moore Chapters Q10, Q11, and Q12 (through Q12.3)

### Week 11 &mdash; Numerical Methods for Solving Schr&ouml;dinger's Equation &mdash; Theory of the Hydrogen Atom &mdash; Spherical Harmonics &mdash; The Dawn of Nuclear Physics, 1896-1911

* Friday, Apr. 5 &mdash; [Nuclear Physics from 1896-1911](./resources/EarlyNuclearHistory.pages.pdf), the discovery of radioactivity, exponential decay and the nucleus following pp. 19-40 of Reed &mdash; Please jump on the historical reading because I would like three groups of two people to springboard from that into class presentations for Friday &mdash; Start Q13: Sections Q13.1, Q13.2 and Q13.6 &mdash; [Problem Set 15](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-04-05.nb.pdf) 

### Week 12 &mdash; Nuclear Physics

### Week 13 &mdash; Nuclear Physics Applications

* Tuesday, Apr. 16 &mdash; Study Q15 &mdash; Presentation by Miles (maybe someone wants to join him!?): How are atoms or electrons or ions counted so as to make 1 mole (abbreviated mol), *in practice*; and in particular, how is the gram which is now defined as 1/12 of the mass of an Avogadro's number (602,214,076,000,000,000,000,000) of Carbon-12 atoms counted, *in practice* &mdash; [Problem Set 18](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-04-16.nb.pdf) &mdash; Choose the two remaining special topics
