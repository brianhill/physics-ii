# Modern Introductory Physics, Part II: Quantum Mechanics &amp; Relativity

*Unofficial Course Title: Quantum Mechanics &amp; Relativity*

*As a class, we should reserve the possibility of modifying this syllabus to go deeper into quantum mechanics &mdash; at the expense of relativity &mdash; based on where we find ourselves early in Term 5.*

## Texts

* For quantum mechanics: [*Six Ideas that Shaped Physics*, 4th Edition, Volumes Q and R](http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas/) by Thomas Moore
* For relativity: [*Six Ideas that Shaped Physics*, 4th Edition, Volumes R](http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas/) by Thomas Moore and/or [Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition](http://www.eftaylor.com/spacetimephysics/) by Edwin F. Taylor and John Archibald Wheeler

## Grading and Assignments

It has been suggested that we have more, lower-stakes exams than we did in the fall semester. I am game to revise the grading method below, and we will discuss this early in Term 4:

* 30% assignments
* 20% for midterm (near the end of term 4)
* 30% for final (near the end of term 5)
* 20% thorough preparation for class and leadership of course 

There will be many problem sets and problem set solutions, and reviewing them will be valuable. To be organized, I recommend locating a three-ring binder and a three-ring hole punch.

Problem sets should be on standard 8 1/2 x 11 paper. Multi-page problem sets should be stapled. Corrections should be erased (if done in pencil) or recopied (if done in pen). To make nice diagrams and graphs, you will very often need a ruler. The nicest technical work is facilitated by engineering pads, such as: [Roaring Spring Engineering Pad at Amazon](https://a.co/d/9vkXSes). You are meant to use one side of engineering paper. It might seem wasteful of trees and money, but it pays off in clarity and organization.

## Absences (and late work)

The College's general policies on absences (and late work) are applicable. There was an email from Ryan on this on September 8, 2022 in response to a flagging Spring 2022 semester. Since that email predates half of you, the essential absence/late policies are reproduced from that email here:

Whereas missed coursework affects both your classmates and professors by lowering the thinking and understanding you bring to a given class, and interrupts the course schedule that has been set up and is adjusted on an ongoing basis with substantial care. The same is true for absences &mdash; whereas a handful of absences might be &ldquo;normal&rdquo; at colleges with large lectures or less serious academics, at Deep Springs we expect students to miss *no classes* save for legitimate health issues or emergencies requiring also missing labor and governance obligations. For a student wishing to submit a course assignment past its required deadline, the student may request an extension on the assignment directly from the professor 48 hours in advance. Within 48 hours of the due date, the student must request an extension directly from the Dean. Exceptions will be granted by the Dean only if the student faces unforeseen and unforeseeable circumstances. A student who misses the deadline will be penalized an amount that is roughly equivalent to a letter grade for each day the assignment is late. Assignments cannot be turned in after solutions and graded assignments have been handed back, which generally happens one to two classes after they were turned in.
