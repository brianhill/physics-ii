# Modern Introductory Physics, Part II: Quantum Mechanics &amp; Relativity

*Unofficial Course Title: Quantum Mechanics &amp; Relativity*

*I reserve the possibility to modify this syllabus to go deeper into quantum mechanics &mdash; at the expense of relativity &mdash; based on the interests of the class and where we find ourselves early in Term 5.*

## Daily Schedules

Detailed daily schedules will be kept retrospectively:

## Text

* [*Six Ideas that Shaped Physics*, 4th Edition, Volumes Q and R](http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas/)

## Grading and Assignments

* 30% assignments
* 20% for midterm (near the end of term 4)
* 30% for final (near the end of term 5)
* 20% thorough preparation for class and leadership of course 

There will be many problem sets and problem set solutions, and reviewing them will be valuable. To be organized, I recommend locating a three-ring binder and a three-ring hole punch.

Problem sets should be on standard 8 1/2 x 11 paper. Multi-page problem sets should be stapled. Corrections should be erased (if done in pencil) or recopied (if done in pen). To make nice diagrams and graphs, you will very often need a ruler. The nicest technical work is facilitated by engineering pads, such as: [Roaring Spring Engineering Pad at Amazon](https://a.co/d/9vkXSes)

## Absences

The College's general policies on absences (and late work) are applicable. There was an email from  Ryan on this September 8, 2022 in response to a flagging Spring 2022 semester. Since that email predates most of you, the essential absence/late policies are reproduced from that email here:

Whereas missed coursework affects both your classmates and professors by lowering the thinking and understanding you bring to a given class, and interrupts the course schedule that has been set up and is adjusted on an ongoing basis with substantial care. The same is true for absences &mdash; whereas a handful of absences might be &ldquo;normal&rdquo; at colleges with large lectures or less serious academics, at Deep Springs we expect students to miss *no classes* save for legitimate health issues or emergencies requiring also missing labor and governance obligations. For a student wishing to submit a course assignment past its required deadline, the student may request an extension on the assignment directly from the professor 48 hours in advance. Within 48 hours of the due date, the student must request an extension directly from the Dean. Exceptions will be granted by the Dean only if the student faces unforeseen and unforeseeable circumstances. A student who misses the deadline will be penalized an amount that is roughly equivalent to a letter grade for each day the assignment is late. Assignments cannot be turned in after solutions and graded assignments have been handed back, which generally happens one to two classes after they were turned in.
