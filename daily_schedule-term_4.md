### Week 1 &mdash; Waves

* Preparation for first class &mdash; Read Sections Q1.1-Q1.3 of *Six Ideas* Unit Q (pp. 4-11) &mdash; Choose a problem to present from the end of Chapter Q1 and pair up with someone to discuss both problems and then present one of your two problems jointly &mdash; Study and complete the handout/worksheet on compression waves that I set out across from the copier

Note: The last problem on the final was partly preparation for what you are now doing with waves &mdash; Wasn't it remarkable that not only *A* sin &omega;*t*  and *B* cos &omega;*t* were solutions of the harmonic oscillator problem, *but also, any combination of those two solutions was a solution?* &mdash; This is the &ldquo;principle of superposition,&rdquo; and the principle is applicable to a large class of differential equations, of which the harmonic oscillator equation and the wave equation are prime examples.
