### Week 4 &mdash; Particles Behave Like Waves &mdash; Exam 1

* Tuesday, Jan. 30 &mdash; Six Ideas Q5 &mdash; Black-body radiation and the resulting appearance of [bluish stars, white and yellowish stars, and reddish stars](./resources/BlackBodyRadiationII.png) &mdash; Presentations on Q1 to Q4: Emma and Ethan, Q1R.1, a slightly tricky Doppler shift problem; Hexi and Miles, Q2R.2, pulsation frequency of variable stars; Rebecca and Ren, Q3R.1, passing by foghorns; Trey, the energy levels and photon spectrum of hydrogen &mdash; [Problem Set 5](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-01-30.nb.pdf) for Tuesday &mdash; Discussion of interference patterns in the first problem of Problem Set 5 &mdash; A look ahead at Q6, spin, beginning with a comparison of the units of angular momentum with the units of *h*
* Friday, Feb. 2 &mdash; [Exam 1](./exams/Exam1.nb.pdf)

### Week 5 &mdash; Spin and Complex Variables

* Tuesday, Feb. 6 &mdash; We will start into both Q6 and complex variables &mdash; Study Sections Q6.1, Q6.2 and Q6.3 of Moore &mdash; Study Sections 1-4 of Churchill, Brown, and Verhey, *Complex Variables and Applications* &mdash; Presentation from Emma, how the Balmer, Lyman, and Paschen wavelengths from Hydrogen were observed and cataloged &mdash; [Problem Set 6](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-02-06.nb.pdf) for Tuesday &mdash; Lecture and handout on [Spin Angular Momentum and Magnetic Moment of the Electron](./resources/AngularMomentumAndMagneticMoment.nb.pdf)
