### Week 1 &mdash; Waves

* Tuesday, Jan. 9 &mdash; Read Sections Q1.1-Q1.3 of *Six Ideas* Unit Q &mdash; Choose a problem to present from the end of Chapter Q1 and pair up with someone to discuss both problems and then present one of your two problems jointly &mdash; Study and complete the handout/worksheet on compression waves that I set out across from the copier

Note: The last problem on the final was partly preparation for what you are now doing with waves &mdash; Wasn't it remarkable that not only *A* sin &omega;*t*  and *B* cos &omega;*t* were solutions of the harmonic oscillator problem, *but also, any combination of those two solutions was a solution?* &mdash; This is the &ldquo;principle of superposition,&rdquo; and the principle is applicable to a large class of differential equations, of which the harmonic oscillator equation and the wave equation are prime examples.

* Friday, Jan. 12 &mdash; Finish *Six Ideas* Q1 &mdash; Finish "The Bridge" handout &mdash; Look ahead to *Six Ideas* Q2 Section 1 &mdash; Problem Set 1 [For Friday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-01-12.nb.pdf)
