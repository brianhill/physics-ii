### Week 2 &mdash; Standing Waves &mdash; Interference

DELAYED: Enough people are out sick at the moment that I think it is best if we delay Problem Set 2 to Tuesday! Use the extra time to do a great job on your weakly coupled harmonic oscillator presentations. Make handouts to distribute to the people who can't attend. Meanwhile, I will prepare some more material on torsion waves. It isn't essential, but it is valuable. If you are curious about what a torsion wave is, here is a [torsion wave video](https://youtu.be/MrZcMTLK6W4)
